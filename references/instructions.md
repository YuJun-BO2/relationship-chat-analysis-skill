# Relationship Chat Analysis Implementation Instructions

You are running the Relationship Chat Analysis skill. The goal is to turn messy chat history into an evidence-grounded relationship dynamics report.

## Constants

```text
CONFIG_FILE = config.json
CLEANING_PROMPT = references/cleaning-prompt.md
EXTRACTION_PROMPT = references/extraction-prompt.md
SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = references/synthesis-prompt.md
BLINDSPOT_PROMPT = references/blindspot-prompt.md
OUTPUT_FOLDER = relationship-analysis
```

## Operating Principles

- Preserve both participants' messages unless the user explicitly asks to analyze only one side.
- Do not diagnose, label, or claim hidden motives as fact.
- Every major conclusion should cite repeated evidence or clearly state that it is tentative.
- Treat missing messages, deleted messages, screenshots without timestamps, and one-sided exports as data quality issues.
- Redact unnecessary private identifiers in final output.
- If safety concerns appear, name the observable behavior and evidence without exaggeration.

## Step 0: Understand Request And Load Config

Infer the user's analysis intent from natural language. Common request types include:

- A full relationship chat analysis.
- A corpus-quality check before full analysis.
- A date-limited analysis, such as "January to March 2026".
- A focused analysis of conflict repair, coldness, mixed signals, breakup, reconciliation, emotional needs, boundaries, or effort balance.

Read `config.json`.

Ask for clarification only if:

- Speaker attribution is impossible.
- The user asks for a conclusion that requires missing context.
- The data may include immediate danger and the user's intent is unclear.

## Stage 1: Corpus Discovery

Find chat files from user-provided paths or the current workspace. Include likely text formats such as `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.html`, and exported chat text. If the user pasted chat content directly, treat the pasted text as the corpus.

For each source, record:

```json
{
  "source_file": "path or pasted-input",
  "source_type": "line|whatsapp|telegram|imessage|messenger|instagram_dm|discord|sms|plain_text|unknown",
  "date_range_observed": "YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD or unknown",
  "participants_observed": ["name_or_alias"],
  "line_count": 0,
  "estimated_message_count": 0,
  "quality_notes": []
}
```

## Stage 2: Normalize And Clean

Read `references/cleaning-prompt.md`.

Normalize chat records into this schema:

```json
{
  "message_id": "stable-id",
  "source_file": "path or pasted-input",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 or null",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD or null",
  "speaker": "person_a|person_b|third_party|system|unknown",
  "speaker_label_original": "raw label",
  "text": "message text",
  "message_type": "text|media|sticker|call|system|deleted|unknown",
  "is_low_signal": false,
  "noise_reason": null,
  "confidence": "high|medium|low"
}
```

Cleaning rules:

- Keep message order even when timestamps are missing.
- Preserve low-signal items in the manifest but exclude them from relationship interpretation unless they matter.
- Label deleted messages and media placeholders; do not infer their content.
- Merge multi-line messages only when they clearly belong to the same speaker and timestamp.
- Deduplicate repeated export blocks.
- Standardize participant aliases to `person_a` and `person_b`; keep a mapping in the manifest.

## Stage 3: Segment Into Episodes

Create episodes based on time gaps, topic shifts, conflict windows, repair attempts, and relationship milestones.

Episode types:

- `ordinary_contact`
- `planning_or_logistics`
- `affection_or_intimacy`
- `emotional_bid`
- `conflict`
- `repair_or_reconnection`
- `distance_or_coldness`
- `boundary_or_pressure`
- `breakup_or_reconciliation`
- `third_party_or_external_stress`
- `unclear`

Episode schema:

```json
{
  "episode_id": "episode-001",
  "date_range": "YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD",
  "episode_type": "conflict",
  "participants": ["person_a", "person_b"],
  "message_count": 0,
  "summary": "brief factual summary",
  "data_quality": "high|medium|low",
  "messages": []
}
```

Dry-run output should include corpus size, participants, date coverage, noise ratio, episode counts by type, and any major attribution or missing-context problems.

## Stage 4: Episode-Level Extraction

Read `references/extraction-prompt.md`.

Process episodes in batches. For each episode, extract relationship dynamics using the schema defined in the extraction prompt. If using parallel agents, each agent should process a disjoint batch and return valid JSON only.

If JSON is malformed:

- Try to salvage by removing markdown fences and locating the outer JSON object or array.
- If still unparseable, log the failed episode and continue.

## Stage 5: Aggregation

Aggregate extraction results by:

- Participant
- Episode type
- Timeline period
- Repeated loop
- Evidence strength
- Safety relevance

Do not count repeated messages from duplicated exports as separate evidence.

Pattern confidence:

- `high`: repeated in 3+ episodes, clear message evidence, low missing-context risk
- `medium`: repeated in 2+ episodes or strong single episode with clear context
- `low`: plausible but limited, ambiguous, or context-dependent

## Stage 6: Cross-Episode Synthesis

Read `references/synthesis-prompt.md`.

Synthesize the final relationship dynamics across configured output sections. Include data quality notes before interpretation so the reader can calibrate trust.

## Stage 7: Blind Spots, Unsupported Claims, And Safety Review

Read `references/blindspot-prompt.md`.

Identify:

- Blind spots for each participant
- Repeating loops neither side seems to resolve
- Claims the user may want to make that the evidence does not support
- Safety concerns requiring caution
- Alternative interpretations that remain plausible

## Stage 8: Final Output

Write to:

```text
relationship-analysis/{TODAY}-relationship-chat-analysis.md
relationship-analysis/{TODAY}-chat-corpus-manifest.json
```

Final report structure:

```markdown
# Relationship Chat Analysis

## Scope And Data Quality
## Relationship Timeline
## Communication Pattern
## Emotional Needs And Bids
## Conflict Escalation Pattern
## Repair And Reconnection Pattern
## Distance, Avoidance, And Coldness
## Boundaries, Pressure, And Safety
## Effort Balance And Power Dynamics
## Repeating Loops
## Blind Spots For Each Person
## What The Evidence Does Not Support

```

Use short quotes with dates. Avoid dumping long private chat excerpts.
